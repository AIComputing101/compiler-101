# Compiler 101: From C to Specialized Compilers

An educational project to teach core compiler concepts through incremental building. Start with a minimal C compiler, then advance to specialized compilers (CUDA, Python, CUDA-Q).


## Project Goal  
Learn compiler design by building one from scratch. Progress through:  
- A minimal C compiler (handling variables, functions, loops, etc.)  
- Specialized compilers for GPU (CUDA), high-level languages (Python), and quantum computing (CUDA-Q).  


## Prerequisites  
- **Tools**: GCC/Clang (C compiler), Python 3.8+ (testing framework), Make (build automation).  
- **Advanced Modules**: CUDA Toolkit (for CUDA compiler), Python development headers (for Python compiler), cuQuantum SDK (for CUDA-Q).  


## Setup  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/compiler-101.git
   cd compiler-101
